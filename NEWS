Version 1.1
===========
* Updated with GSOC contributions, thanks (and authorship) go to Andrea Storey.
* Added unit tests.
* Added functionality to calculate the banded and tapered estimate from McMurry and Politis (2010)
* Moved the target and lambda values (crucial in estimation) to the argument list with the previous values as defaults. This gives the user more control if wanted.
* Updated documentation.
* Pulled out the NND part from corrected.R into a separate function so it can be used both with bandtap estimates and penalized estimates.

Version 1.0.0.2
===============
